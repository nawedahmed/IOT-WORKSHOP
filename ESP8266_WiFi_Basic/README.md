# ESP8266 WiFi Basics

This folder contains basic ESP8266 WiFi examples used in the IoT Workshop. The goal is to understand ESP8266 WiFi modes before connecting sensors or cloud platforms.

---

## 1. WiFi Network Scanning

* Shows SSID, signal strength (RSSI), and encryption type
* 📌 Identify available networks


---

## 2. WiFi Station Mode (STA)

* Connects to home/campus WiFi
* Gets IP from router
* Used for Internet and cloud IoT
* 📌 Most common mode

---

## 3. WiFi Access Point Mode (AP)

* Creates its own WiFi network
* Devices connect directly
* No external router required
* 📌 Useful for local control

---

## 4. WiFi AP + STA Mode

* Connects to router (STA) and creates its own AP
* Allows configuration while staying online
* 📌 Advanced IoT devices

---

## 5. ESP8266 WiFi Information

* Read IP, MAC, RSSI, connected network details
* 📌 Helps debugging and network understanding

---

## Hardware Required

* ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
* USB Cable
* Laptop with Arduino IDE

---

## Software Required

* Arduino IDE
* ESP8266 Board Package installed

---

## Notes for Students
