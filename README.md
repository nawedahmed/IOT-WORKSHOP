## ✅ Required Libraries:

### for Blynk, we will add it on ( Day 3 )  so for now skip it.
---
1. Blynk Library (v1.0.1)
- 🔹 Go to Arduino IDE → Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries
- 🔹 Search for: Blynk
- 🔹 Install the one by Volodymyr Shymanskyy (NOT Blynk IoT or Blynk.Edgent – just "Blynk").
---


## 2. ESP8266WiFi Library
🔹 This comes automatically with the ESP8266 board package. You don’t need to install it separately.

## ✅ Board Package:

You must install the ESP8266 board package for Arduino.

📦 How to install:

1. Go to File → Preferences

2. In the “Additional Board Manager URLs” field, paste this:

```text
https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
```

3. Then go to Tools → Board → Boards Manager

4. Search: ESP8266 and install it (by ESP8266 Community)

## ✅ Board Selection:

After installation, go to
Tools → Board → select "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)"
(or Generic Esp8266 module")

## ✅ Notes:

* Make sure your COM port is correctly selected in Tools → Port.

* Select proper baud rate (usually 115200 or 9600) under Tools → Upload Speed.

* Connect your board to PC via USB before uploading.

## 🚗  DC Motor Control – ESP8266 + L298N :

</p>


A **DC motor** converts electrical energy into mechanical rotation.
The **L298N motor driver** allows a low-power microcontroller (ESP8266) to control a high-current motor safely.

As specified in L298N H-Bridge module the motor driver has a two motor terminal block to connect DC motor. Output A+ /- and Output B+/- .

The L298N H-Bridge module has facilitate with additional external input power supply source to handling handle starting current requirement for both DC motor. This three terminal block with +12V, GND, and +5V. The +12V terminal block is used to power up the motors. The +5V terminal is used to power up the L298N chip. If you supply more than 12V, you need to remove the jumper and supply 5V to the +5V terminal.

- +12V: The +12V terminal is where you should connect your power supply
- GND: power supply GND
- +5V: provide 5V if jumper is removed. Acts as a 5V output if jumper is in place
- Jumper: jumper in place – uses the motors power supply to power up the chip. Jumper removed: you need to provide 5V to the +5V terminal. If you supply more than 12V, you should remove the jumper

**Key concepts used:**

* **Direction control** → using IN1 / IN2 and IN3 / IN4 pins
* **Speed control** → using PWM on EN pin
* **Wi-Fi control** → ESP8266 in AP mode & Internet mode
* **Human interface** → Buttons, Joystick, Blynk IoT APP

This project is structured **step-by-step**, from **basic motor ON/OFF** to **smart IoT voice control**, so learners understand *how control complexity increases*.



## 🔹 Code Flow (Learning Order):

### 1️⃣ Single Motor (Basic)

<img src="https://github.com/nawedahmed/IOT-WORKSHOP/blob/main/Station%202/image/ESP8266-DC-Motor_bb.png.webp" width="500">

**Goal:** Understand motor direction

* ESP8266 → L298N
* Forward / Reverse using digital HIGH–LOW
* No Wi-Fi, no speed control

➡️ *Foundation of motor logic*



### 2️⃣ AP Mode – No Speed Control

**Goal:** Control motor wirelessly (local)

* ESP8266 creates its own Wi-Fi (AP mode)
* Web page buttons: Forward / Reverse / Stop
* Motor runs at fixed speed

➡️ *Introduces Wi-Fi + web control*



### 3️⃣ AP Mode – With Speed Control

**Goal:** Learn PWM motor control

* EN pin connected to PWM
* Speed varies using slider (0–1023)
* Direction + speed together

➡️ *Core motor control concept*



### 4️⃣ Joystick Control

**Goal:** Human-like control

* Joystick Y-axis → speed
* Joystick direction → motor direction
* Real-time response

➡️ *Analog input + control mapping*



### 5️⃣ Blynk IoT (Internet Control)

**Goal:** Full IoT control

* Control motor from **anywhere**
* Button / Slider / ( via Blynk)
* Internet-based operation
